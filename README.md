# Artificial Vision

This repository contains a series of practical labs focused on key concepts in image processing and computer vision. 
The labs cover a wide range of topics, including image loading, manipulation, and color processing, as well as more advanced techniques like edge detection, image segmentation, and object detection. 
Methods such as Gaussian filters, template matching, and feature extraction (ORB, HOG), along with face detection using Haar-like features and PCA. These practicum exercises were designed to provide hands-on experience in fundamental image processing, 
filtering, and object recognition.

===========================================================================

## Practicum 1: Basics on Image Processing and Manipulation
===========================================================================

The main topics are:

1. Image loading, saving and creation

2. Color manipulation

In order to complete this practicum, we will work with the following concepts: image creation, data types, image manipulation.




===========================================================================
## Practicum 2: Filtering and edge detection

===========================================================================

The main topics are:
1. Image smoothing and convolution (exercises 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4)
2. Edge detection (exercises 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7)

In order to complete this practicum, the following concepts need to be understood: linear filters, histograms, convolutions, and edges.

The following chapters of the book "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Richard Szeliski provide additional information:
* Chapter 3. Image processing: Point operators & linear filtering.
* Chapter 4. Feature detection and matching: Edges.

## Practicum 3: Image and Video Segmentation

===========================================================================

The main topics of Laboratory 3 are:

3.1. Segmentation of video shots with static scenes.

3.2. Background subtraction.

3.3. Segmentation of images.

The following chapters of the book “Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applicatons” from Richard Szeliski have further information about the topic:

* Chapter 4: Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications.

* Chapter 5: Segmentation.

## Practicum 4: Descriptors extraction for object detection, based on template matching, ORB, and HOG

===========================================================================

The main topics of Laboratory 4 are:

    4.1) SSD and Normalized Cross-correlation for template matching

    4.2) HOG image descriptor for object (person) detection

    4.3) Recognition by correspondance, based on feature extraction (ORB)

In order to complete this practicum, the following concepts need to be understood: template matching, feature localization (Harris, Censure), feature descriptor (HOG,ORB, Sift) methods.

## Practicum 5: 

===========================================================================

This lab covers the following topics: 

* Gaussian filters
* Descriptors based on texture
* Distance between images and similarity search
* Face detection using:
    * Haar-like features
    * Adaboost
    * PCA
